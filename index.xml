      <description>Worked with a dataset of homes for sale in Brazil. The goal is to determine if there are regional differences in the real estate market, and to look at southern Brazil to see if there is a relationship between home size and price.
 Combined CSV files of real estate data from Brazil and cleaned the data for exploration. Used data visualization skills to explore more about the regional differences in the Brazilian real estate market.</description>
